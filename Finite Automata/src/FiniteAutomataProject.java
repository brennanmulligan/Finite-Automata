        * Program Description: This project simulates a Deterministic
        * Finite Automata. Based on a predetermined DFA and alphabet
        * in a text file, the user can enter a string to be evaluated
        * by the program. The program will accurately determine if the
        * string would be accepted by the DFA or rejected due to not
        * ending in an accepting state or having a letter that is not
        * part of the alphabet.
